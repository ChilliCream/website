            <description><![CDATA[<p>Originally, I wanted to write a little post about what we are currently working on in version 9 and how those things are coming along, but every time I started writing on this post it got longer and longer and it felt a bit too messy.</p>
<p>Starting with this post we will start talking about version 9 in more detail. We will split this into several blog posts that will cover different parts of the new version. This post will focus on the type system improvements.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I was asked in our slack channel how one could write an integration test against <em>Hot Chocolate</em> without setting up an ASP.Net Core <em>TestServer</em>.
Though the ASP.Net Core <em>TestServer</em> API is quite nice, it is much more cumbersome to test a schema this way.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>One common question that comes up on our slack channel is if <em>Hot Chocolate</em> supports some kind of logging infrastructure. My personal opinion here is that logging/tracing is often very project specific and an API should not force one specific logging solution onto its users.</p>
<p>Instead we have opted to provide diagnostic events through Microsoft`s diagnostic source which does not force us to serialize any payloads. This in turn gives you the ability to pick and choose the information that best fits your need for your tracing/logging solution.</p>
<p>This post will walk you through on how to add a logger of your choice to <em>Hot Chocolate</em> and get exactly the right amount of information for your project.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>With version 8 of Hot Chocolate we have mainly focused on schema stitching. One of the most requested features in this area was auto-stitching. Auto-stitching will enable us to automatically pull in schemas from other GraphQL servers and merge those into one schema.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we have released Hot Chocolate <code>0.7.0</code>, containing one cool new feature,
we wanne talk about here, namely <em>Apollo Tracing</em> which is extremely powerful in
identifing things like performance bottlenecks in our <em>GraphQL</em> <em>APIs</em> for
example. As a result, we had to enhance our general instrumentation layer, which
we all benefit from. For instance, now it's way easier to register a
<em>DiagnosticObserver</em> and bring in your own tracing framework, respectively. In
this blog article we will focus on these two topics.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently run into an HTTP 404 error when calling /docs on my <em>Docusaurus</em> websites. This isn't
actually nice, because I expected to land on my documentation entry page e.g. introduction. First I
thought, perhaps this is an issue with my setup. But I found out that even the <em>Docusaurus</em> website
itself is suffering from this issue as well. So I tried to find a solution on the internet. But
I couldn't find anything except an issue on github describing the same behavior. So, with this article
I try to help everyone saving their time and making the experience with <em>Docusaurus</em> even better.</p>
