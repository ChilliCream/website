            <description><![CDATA[<p>We are currently working on version 8 of Hot Chocolate and are mainly focusing on schema stitching with this release.</p>
<p>One of the most requested features in this area was auto-stitching. Auto-stitching will enable us to automatically pull in schemas from other GraphQL servers and merge those into one schema.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we have released Hot Chocolate <code>0.7.0</code>, containing one cool new feature,
we wanne talk about here, namely <em>Apollo Tracing</em> which is extremely powerful in
identifing things like performance bottlenecks in our <em>GraphQL</em> <em>APIs</em> for
example. As a result, we had to enhance our general instrumentation layer, which
we all benefit from. For instance, now it's way easier to register a
<em>DiagnosticObserver</em> and bring in your own tracing framework, respectively. In
this blog article we will focus on these two topics.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently run into an HTTP 404 error when calling /docs on my <em>Docusaurus</em> websites. This isn't
actually nice, because I expected to land on my documentation entry page e.g. introduction. First I
thought, perhaps this is an issue with my setup. But I found out that even the <em>Docusaurus</em> website
itself is suffering from this issue as well. So I tried to find a solution on the internet. But
I couldn't find anything except an issue on github describing the same behavior. So, with this article
I try to help everyone saving their time and making the experience with <em>Docusaurus</em> even better.</p>
