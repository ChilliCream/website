When you think about how we build up our GraphQL schemas with _Hot Chocolate_ we always need to fall back to either the schema types or the GraphQL SDL. This brings with it a lot of boiler plate code that we actually could infer from C# code. We decided to push some of the version 11 features down to the version 10 branch to make this possible today.

<!--truncate-->

## Nullability

First, let us get the obvious out of the way. C# now has nullable reference types, or actually they now have non-null reference types. It does not matter how you look at it but the result is that we now can differentiate between nullable reference types and reference types that cannot be null.

With version 10.3.0-preview.2 we can now infer this and you finally do not need helpers like attributes and other things to define your schema types. We got you covered now :)

So, a simple schema like the following:

```csharp
public class Query
{
    /// <summary>
    /// This field says hello.
    /// </summary>
    public string SayHello(string? name)
    {
        return name is null ? "Hello!" : $"Hello {name}!"
    }
}
```

Is now correctly inferred to:

```graphql
type Query {
  "This field says hello."
  sayHello(name: String): String!
}
```

Do not get me wrong here, I still love our schema types and we will nod get rid of them since they are the foundation of every schema. In fact we use them still in the background.

## Interfaces

Let us dig some deeper with some interfaces. _Hot Chocolate_ can since the version 10 also infer interfaces. This means that we will correctly infer interfaces and their usage.

```csharp
public class Query
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Get my pet :)
    /// </summary>
    public IPet? GetPet(int id)
    {
        // some code
    }
}

public interface IPet
{
    // some code
}

public class Dog : IPet
{
    // some code
}

public class Cat : IPet
{
    // some code
}

SchemaBuilder.New()
    .AddQuery<Query>()
    .AddType<Dog>()
    .AddType<Cat>()
    .Create();
```

```graphql
type Query {
  "Get my pet :)"
  pet(id: Int!): IPet
}

interface Pet {
    // fields
}

type Dog implements Pet {
    // fields
}

type Cat implements Pet {
    // fields
}
```

This feels awesome. The schema builder translates our C# mode exactly the way it is meant to be. We do not have to tell the schema builder any more how to do that.

## Descriptor Attributes

But what about field middleware and other more complex features like type extensions and so on.

This was something I contemplated for a long time but we are solving this now with powerful descriptor attributes. This basically allows you to create attributes for your schema in which you have access to the descriptors. Let me give you an example for this.
Let's say we want to create a simple middleware that can be put on fields and that applies a `ToUpper` on every resulting string in the resolver pipeline.

```csharp
public sealed class ToUpperAttribute : ObjectFieldDescriptorAttribute
{
    protected override void OnConfigure(IObjectFieldDescriptor descriptor)
    {
        descriptor.Use(next => async ctx =>
        {
            await next(ctx);

            if(ctx.Result is string s)
            {
                ctx.Result = s.ToUpperInvariant();
            }
        })
    }
}
```

The neat thing is that we have full access to all the things we have on our fluent API and we can easily package this into attributes that we can then apply to our clean C# code.

```csharp
public class Query
{
    /// <summary>
    /// This field says hello.
    /// </summary>
    [ToUpper]
    public string SayHello(string? name)
    {
        return name is null ? "Hello!" : $"Hello {name}!"
    }
}
```

This allows us to enable the full power of schema types with clean C# schemas. The new attributes will arrive with 10.3.0-preview.3. We will add attributes for each descriptor type. Moreover, you can apply input and output attributes on the same model and we will create automatically an output- and an input-version of that type.

## Type Extensions

Another thing we want to make better with 10.3.0 are the code-first type extensions. You could already do cool things with the type extensions but there are two things that did not feel nice enough.

First, we could not define a type for the extensions. We had to either declare fields and provide the file there or we had to specify the field with a string name.

```csharp
public class FooExtension : ObjectTypeExtension
{
    protected override void Configure(ObjectTypeDescriptor descriptor)
    {
        descriptor.Name("Foo");
        descriptor.Field<Foo>(t => t.Bar).Use(...);
        descriptor.Field("baz").Use(...);
    }
}
```

With the new version we can now basically do the same than we do with standard types:

```csharp
public class FooExtension : ObjectTypeExtension<Foo>
{
    protected override void Configure(ObjectTypeDescriptor<Foo> descriptor)
    {
        descriptor.Name("Foo");
        descriptor.Field(t => t.Bar).Use(...);
    }
}
```

## Optional

Another concept we will introduce with 10.3.0 is optionals. This is often a thing we want to use when we are talking about input types. We have introduced this concept already with _Strawberry Shake_ an like it a lot.

So, we are porting it now back to the server. In your resolvers you can now use for every argument the optional wrapper type and this will tell you if the argument was not provided, allowing you to easily do partial updates.

```csharp
public async Task<Foo> GetMyFoo(Optional<string> id)
{
    // ...
}
```

Also you can use optionals in input objects.

```csharp
public class Foo
{
    public Optional<string> Bar { get; set; }
}
```

The nice thing with the inputs are that they implicitly convert.

```csharp
var foo = new Foo { Bar = "My String" };
```

## Wrapping it up

_Hot Chocolate_ will bring a lot new improvements to how we can create our schemas. All these change are just additions and there are no breaking changes involved meaning we give you a lot of version 11 productivity now.

So, when can you expect 10.3.0. We will deliver nullable ref types with 10.3.0-preview.2 and the attributes will come 10.3.0-preview.3. We think the final should be ready end of next week. We initially planned end of this week but we still have some bug fixing to do.

I hope you are exited as I am about this. Happy Thanksgiving :)
